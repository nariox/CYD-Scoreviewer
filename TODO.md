# TODO

## Done

- [x] ESP-IDF project scaffold (CMake, sdkconfig, deps)
- [x] LVGL 9 integration with ST7789 SPI display on CYD2USB
- [x] Splash screen: basketball icon + "Sami's basketball" / "score viewer"
- [x] Cards screen: "NBA SCORES" header + empty scroll container
- [x] 3-second splash then transition to cards screen (one-shot LVGL timer)
- [x] Pinout for CYD2USB (HSPI: MOSI=13, MISO=12, SCLK=14, CS=15, DC=2, RST=4, BL=21)
- [x] Clean build artifacts and .gitignore
- [x] tools/ directory with source PNG and conversion script
- [x] Settings screen with static C callbacks (no lambdas)
- [x] Wifi screen with back button, Wi-Fi switch, network list, IP config
- [x] Cards screen with gear/settings button in header
- [x] LEDC backlight PWM init on GPIO 21
- [x] BOYA flash chip, 4MB flash, single app partition config
- [x] Touch poll task (50ms) + LVGL indev registration
- [x] Touch test screen (9 buttons + live coords label)
- [x] Calibration screen (4 corners, raw ADC display, long-press undo, quadrant validation)
- [x] Calibration button in settings screen
- [x] Touch integration rewrite: LVGL indev callback, XPT2046 mapping, no redundant poll task
- [x] Touch integration wired into app_main.c (splash → cards, settings → calibration)
- [x] Calibration screen wired into boot flow (NVS check for calibration data)
- [x] NVS calibration persistence (save/load calibration data + saved flag)
- [x] NVS calibration validation (range check 0-4095, x_max>x_min, y_max>y_min)
- [x] Calibration back navigation (calibration_screen_set_back_scr to return to settings)
- [x] Calibration state reset when accessed from settings (calibration_screen_reset)
- [x] Splash timer fixed to one-shot (lv_timer_set_repeat_count = 1, not infinite)
- [x] Wi-Fi backend: esp_wifi state machine (scan/connect/retry timer), scan on worker task, credentials saved to NVS
- [x] Wi-Fi screen live flow: scan networks → SSID/password entry with keyboard → connect; saved networks list with delete
- [x] Boot auto-connect to last saved network; splash holds until connected (or falls back after 5s with retry timer)
- [x] Wi-Fi status badge on cards header (green/amber/red by connection state)
- [x] Thread-safe Wi-Fi/UI integration: lvgl_port_lock around every cross-task LVGL call
- [x] NBA API client (BallDontLie v1): `nba_api.c/h` — HTTPS via esp_http_client + esp_crt_bundle (cross-signed verify on), cJSON via espressif/cjson managed component, date-range fetch + preseason fallback, ~15-game memory budget
- [x] Clock sync for API date windows: `time_sync.c/h` — parses HTTP `Date` header from the API host (no NTP), sets system time, formats "YYYY-MM-DD" windows
- [x] Console sample: on first Wi-Fi connect, one-shot `nba_demo_task` prints last-7-days games (preseason fallback) to serial

## In Progress (Blocking)

*(None — touch integration is complete and wired)*

## Next

### 1. NBA API → cards screen
- Populate cards container with `nba_api_fetch_games()` data (status badge per card)
- Auto-refresh on interval (LVGL timer → worker task; respect balldontlie rate limits)
- Pagination via `meta.next_cursor` if a window has more than one page of games
- Remove/replace `nba_demo_task` in app_main.c once the screen shows live data

### 2. Live score cards
- Team logos, scores, game status display
- Tap card → game detail view

### 3. Game detail view
- Tap a card to see expanded game info

### 4. NVS brightness persistence
- Brightness slider already saves to NVS on change — verify it loads on boot

### 5. Touch rotation tuning
- XPT2046 driver flags (`swap_xy`, `mirror_x`, `mirror_y`) may need per-device tuning
- Current: driver flags all false, rotation handled in `touch_process_coordinates`
